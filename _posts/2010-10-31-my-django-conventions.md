**UPDATE [09-21-2011]**: I won't be doing this series, at least not in this fashion. It is much easier to write of conventions as they are discovered.

I am going to begin a series of posts regarding conventions I have used when developing Django powered web sites and web applications. This includes but not limited to: project directory structure, comments on version control with respect to the project files, paradigms, commonly used third-party apps, and useful snippets of code. This will all be wrapped up in examples to where and when I have come across them.

Everyone has there own coding styles and habits, but just as I was influenced by many, I hope to influence and ultimately provide more reason behinds my habits. Below are some initial posts that I will write eventually.

- the project directory structure
- RESTful APIs
- [an introduction to django-avocado](/an-introduction-to-django-avocado)
- the problem with apps
- ETL and Django
- Apps I want to try
