This is Part 1 of a series of posts on various notes and takeaways from the book [Lean UX: Applying Lean Principles to Improve User Experience](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920021827.do) focusing on **Core Elements**, **Assumptions**, and **Hypotheses**.

## Core Elements

_Definitions are quoted directly from the book.. because they are good._

- **Assumptions** - A high-level declaration of what we believe to be true.
- **Hypotheses** - More granular descriptions of our assumptions that target specific areas of our product or workflows for experimentation.
- **Outcomes** - The signal we seek from the market to help us validate or invalidate our hypotheses. These are often quantitative but can also be qualitative.
- **Personas** - Models of the people for whom we believe we are solving a problem.
- **Features** - The product changes or improvements we believe will drive the outcomes we seek.

### Assumptions

#### Purpose

> Every project starts with assumptions, but usually we don't explicitly acknowledge this fact. Instead, we try to ignore assumptions, or worse, treat them as facts.
> ...
> Declaring assumptions allows your team to create a common starting point.
> ...
> It reveals the team's divergence of opinions and also exposes a broad set of possible solutions.

#### Preliminary Questions

- how is the current product being used in lieu of the issue?
- were their any past attempts to fix the issue? (successes and failures)
- how have/are other products handling this issue?

#### Problem Statement

Define (and agree upon) a problem statement as a starting point. Include:

- Statement (assessment) of the goals of the product
- All known constraints
- Statement of improvement (independent of the solution)

#### Risk Assessment & Prioritization

Simply, _what are the risks associated with each assumption?_

The higher the risk, the greater need to test or address the assumption.

```
         high risk
             |
             |
known ----------------- unkown
             |
             |
          low risk
```

### Hypotheses

#### Test Assumptions

The general template:

> We believe **[this statement is true]**.
> We will know we're **[right/wrong]** when we see the following feedback from the market:
> **[qualitative feedback]** and/or **[quantitative feedback]** and/or **[key performance indicator change]**

This method removes subjective and political influence from the assessment and decision-making.
