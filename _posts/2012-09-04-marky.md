summary: Marky is Web-based Markdown previewer that updates as you type. Check it out: [http://marky.devel.io][1]

Alternate markup languages to HTML have become increasingly more prolific due to their simplicity and readability. Among the [crew](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_document_markup_languages), John Gruber's [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax has arguably become the de facto for most blog engines, commenting systems and many things in between.

When I am not writing up a GitHub issue or comment, I get frustrated not having an easy to preview my Markdown before I make use of it. So I wrote [Marky][1] which is live previewer.

It is implemented as a Django app here: [https://github.com/bruth/marky]()

It supports a few extensions such as:

- Table of Contents (though a bit buggy)
- Superscript and subscript text
- Pygments highlighting
- Footnotes
- Abbreviations
- Autolinks
- Real newline breaks
- .. and few other

_Check out the current list of extensions [here](https://github.com/bruth/marky/blob/master/marky/views.py)._

Most of the extensions are built-in to the [Python Markdown](http://freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/) implementation with a few additions.

## Future

Some additional ideas I have thought about:

- Support exporting a zip/tarball of the HTML and CSS for quick one-off editing
- Support cross-origin requests for JavaScript client library integration
    - Refactoring the current JavaScript client code as a standalone script for a drop-in previewer
    - Better mobile support (media queries are currently being used, but the scrolling is a bit flaky)
    - Drop-and-drop of a Markdown document from the OS which loads the contents in the browser
    - _Smart_ preview scrolling based on the location of the last edit

Tickets for these ideas and others have been created. Feel free provide your opinion and [open new tickets](https://github.com/bruth/marky/issues) for your own ideas (or issues).
