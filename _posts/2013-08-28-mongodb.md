### Schemas

- The schema vs. schemaless argument boils down to whether the database system requires a _predefined_ schema
- Data that _is_ schemaless could be a nightware to work with
- If not explicitly defined, most data have a natural schema
- Shoving any and all data into a single target (e.g. a MongoDB collection) is roughly equivalent to writing all that data to a text file. It will have to be parsed for it to be useable.

### Use Cases

- Storage for _longer_-term cache when something like [memcached](memcached.org) is too volatile or data structures are needed
- Intermediate or staging storage for [ETL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load)
