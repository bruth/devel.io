title: JSON unmarshaling of primitive values
---

A common pattern in [Go](https://golang.org/) is using [constants](https://blog.golang.org/constants) for [enumerable sets of values](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Iota). Although not required, it is recommended to define a custom type for holding the constant values.

```go
type Size uint8

const (
	_ Size = iota
	Small
	Medium
	Large
)
```

One consideration when using integer-based constants is how they will be encoded outside of the program. For example, if the size is JSON encoded, it will be encoded as the number it corresponds to, `Small` is `1`. To external programs this isn't useful since the context of the number is lost.

The standard technique for handling this is implementing the [Marshaler](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Marshaler) and [Unmarshaler](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#Unmarshaler) interfaces on the custom type. If we are choosing to encode `Size` as a string then it makes sense to implement the [Stringer](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Stringer) interface as well.

```go
// String returns the size encoded as a string.
func (s Size) String() string {
	switch s {
	case 1:
		return "small"
	case 2:
		return "medium"
	case 3:
		return "large"
	}
	return ""
}

// MarshalJSON encodes the type as a string.
func (s Size) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error) {
    // Simply call the `String()` method to get the corresponding string.
	return json.Marshal(s.String())
}

// UnmarshalJSON decodes the JSON representation into the native size.
func (s *Size) UnmarshalJSON(b []byte) error {
    // Since the bytes are of a JSON string, simply decode it as a string first.
    // If there is a problem here, return the error.
	var x string
	if err := json.Unmarshal(b, &x); err != nil {
		return err
	}

    // Switch on the string and set the Size to the corresponding constant value.
    // Note that this method was defined as a pointer receiver so we can assign
    // the new value into that memory location. If this is confusing read this:
    // https://golang.org/doc/faq#methods_on_values_or_pointers
	switch x {
	case "small":
		*s = Small
	case "medium":
		*s = Medium
	case "large":
		*s = Large
	}
	
	return nil
}
```
